# esp8266-PCF8574

This repository contains an ESP8266 sketch that communicates over I2C to a breakout board that contains a PCF8574 (*a remote 8-bit I/O expander for the I2C bus*).

# History

This project started out as a *proof of concept* for another project that required additional digital inputs and outputs. The platform I was working with is an ESP-01S, and the PCF8475 seemed to be a perfect match.

I researched a number of PCF9475 options including wiring up my own circuit. However I found a board that was configured almost as I needed.
